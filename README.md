# Personal_Finance_Management
The Personal Finance Management System (PFMS) is a web application where users can manage their personal finances, including tracking income, expenses, and budgeting. This will help users track their spending habits and make better financial decisions. The core idea is that the system allows users to:

## Record transactions (income and expenses).
- Categorize transactions (e.g., food, rent, utilities).
- View reports and summaries (e.g., monthly balance, expenses by category).
- Manage and track their budget.

## Key Features:
- Transaction Management: Add, edit, and delete transactions (e.g., income, expenses).
- Categories: Categorize transactions (e.g., food, rent, utilities).
- Budgeting: Set a budget for each category and track spending against it.
- Reporting: Generate summaries and reports of transactions (e.g., income vs. expenses, spending trends).
- Charts and Graphs: Visualize income, expenses, and trends through graphs (e.g., pie chart, line chart).
